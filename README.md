# Grocery List App
We are two colleagues who completed a Full Stack Programming course together and decided to build our first major project after finishing the course.

Our application allows users to create and manage shopping lists by adding products they plan to buy. The goal is to make grocery shopping easier and more organized.

With this project, we put into practice all the technologies we learned during our course. In addition, we challenged ourselves to go beyond what we had been taught by learning and integrating new technologies such as:

* Spring Security – for user registration and authentication
* React – for building a modern and responsive frontend
* Railway – to deploy the application and make it available in a production environment

This project represents not only our technical growth but also our commitment to continuous learning and improvement as full stack developers.

## Languages and technologies

* Java, Spring Boot, Spring Security, JWT, REST API, PostgreSQL
